Juice has fairly lax guidelines. Following the rules below, it should be fairly easy to port and make icons with relative uniformity.

**Setup:**
  - Clone the repo
  - Locate icons and associated files in `Build/Library/Themes/`
  - Do what you want
  
**Prerequisites:**
  - Icons are currently made in GIMP. While not neccessary to do so, it is highly encouraged
    - If making in GIMP, while again not necessary, it is encouraged to attach a finished GIMP project file in the "GIMP" directory
    
**Basics:**
   - Icon Size: 512px * 512px
   
**Shadows:**
  - Shadow X: 0
  - Shadow Y: -10
    - Change accordingly if a different icon size is needed
  - Blur Radius: 0
  - Opacity: 60%
  - Color: Black(#000000)
  
**When Importing an SVG with small padding:**
  - Icon Size: 450px * 450px
  - Change Canvas Size to 512px * 512px
  - X and Y difference: 31px
  
  **Exporting:**
    - Leave on default settings, or change as you please
      - If icons look "crunchy" after importing, make sure you apply antialiasing from `Filters, Enhance, Antialias`
